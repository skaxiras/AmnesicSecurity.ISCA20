Delay On Miss and VP

\paragraph{Why is Delay on Miss so good to begin with}
Explain that we gain a lot out of intra-cache-line MLP.
If possible give a breakdown of inra-cache-line MLP vs. iter-cache-line MLP.
We lose the second and that's what we experience as performance loss.

\paragraph{Why VP cannot offer much on top}
VP needs to be validated. In order! Non-speculative load-load reordering cannot hep here as we are bound by a new speculation: VP-speculation (VP-Shadow).

\subsection{Data Recomputation}
\label{sec:recmp}
%\input{recmp} We do not need more sub-levels do we?
Proposed as a way to trade in-core computation (cheap in energy) to data movement (expensive in energy) and at the same time perform better when the latency to re-compute is less than the latency to move data throughout the memory hierarchy.
\paragraph{Why RC can offer beyond VP}
No need to validate, hence betrer performance, less energy
