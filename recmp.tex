--Both Spectre and Meltdown exploit speculative meta-data (generated by speculative loads).
--Target: Speculative code that makes *any* change in microarchitectural state, specifically cache hierarchy
    -- "Any futuristic attack caused by a speculative load" [InvisiSpec]
    -- What todo about stores?
    -- Does the type of load speculation matter? 
        --Mem consistency violation (depends on consistency model)
            -- A load reading data (i.e., being performed) before other loads or stores --preceding the load in program order-- are performed, may cause such violations...
        --Instr. at ROB head squashed (due to an exception e.g.), load was subsequent...
        --Branch misprediction (preceding branch)
        --St with address speculation; once address is calculated and matches a later load's (which already read data speculatively).
    -- We make speculation invisible in the data-cache, similar to InvisiSpec...
    -- We assume that everything operates correctly
