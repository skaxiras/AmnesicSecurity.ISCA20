    1 Problem statement: 
        Spectre, Meltdown, ++?
    2 Summary of recent arch. solutions
        Making speculative data invisible
        2.1 Overhead & complexity per se
        2.2 Limitations
        2.3 Coverage
    3 Proposed solution: 
        Recompute speculative load values
        3.1 Overhead & complexity 
            Put into perspective
        3.2 Limitations 
        3.3 Coverage
        3.4 Putting it all together:
            * Orthogonal to which, 
                alternative to what, ... wrt 2
            * Open new vulnerabilities?
